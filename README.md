# Precision Health Informatics Core
An expert lead resource providing (Big) data analysis and computational capabilities for the design and execution of genomics and health informatic driven translational projects.

_Embedded within Prof. Richard Dobson’s “Health Informatics” Group, part of the Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, KCL_

### The mission of the core is three fold:

1. Enable the SLAM BRC & IoPPN KCL community to analyse the large volume of genomics & EHR data, through the provision of services and collaborations and the development of an infrastructure, which can be horizontally shared across different projects and therapeutic areas.

2. Connect different types of information by developing solutions to bridge the gap between different data layers (e.g. patient records, genomics/proteomics data, projects) and groups (e.g. BRC cores, academic groups)

3. Discover novel insights from real world population health data (EHR), novel therapeutic targets, disease biomarkers, and dissect mechanisms underpinning different diseases, by running scientific collaborations which leverage on capabilities developed in 1 and 2.

The SLAM BRC Bioinformatics Core serves as a central point of contact and venue for collaboration with bioinformatics, Health Informatic and computational biology specialists within the SLAM BRC & IoPPN KCL community and is expected to interact with different entities, including internal academic, hospital and BRC groups as well as external and industrial partners.
