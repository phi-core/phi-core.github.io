# Precision Health Informatics Core

The Precision Health Informatics Core is embedded within Prof. Richard Dobson’s “Health Informatics” Group, part of the Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, KCL. 

We are an expert lead resource providing (Big) data analysis and computational capabilities for the design and execution of genomics and health informatic driven translational projects.


## The mission of the core is three fold:

1. Enable the SLAM BRC & IoPPN KCL community to analyse the large volume of genomics & EHR data, through the provision of services and collaborations and the development of an infrastructure, which can be horizontally shared across different projects and therapeutic areas.

2. Connect different types of information by developing solutions to bridge the gap between different data layers (e.g. patient records, genomics/proteomics data, projects) and groups (e.g. BRC cores, academic groups)

3. Discover novel insights from real world population health data (EHR), novel therapeutic targets, disease biomarkers, and dissect mechanisms underpinning different diseases, by running scientific collaborations which leverage on capabilities developed in 1 and 2.

The SLAM BRC Bioinformatics Core serves as a central point of contact and venue for collaboration with bioinformatics, Health Informatic and computational biology specialists within the SLAM BRC & IoPPN KCL community and is expected to interact with different entities, including internal academic, hospital and BRC groups as well as external and industrial partners.

## Bioinformatics Training

We offer basic Bioinformatics training on supported analyses solutions to individuals and labs upon request.

## Funding
The Core is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London. 

## Operation and Costing Model

We work collaboratively with core users to ensure the highest quality and integrity of data outputs and analysis.

The team will work with you to evaluate your research project proposals and design an appropriate experimental design for bioinformatics processing and data analysis.

Once the design is agreed the team will plan and allocate appropriate resources, undertake the bioinformatics processing, analyse the data and results, and communicate these to the research project team.

**Three Tiered Service/Collaboration Model**  

1. Fee-for-Service  
2. Basic Collaboration  
3. Full Collaboration  

**Costing**  

We run the Core under a mixture of fee-for-service and grant funded costing models. 
 
The costs and not-for-profit and used to cover Core staff time (RACE FEC) for internal and external non-BRC funded projects*, Rosalind [add link] HPC and storage costs, AWS cloud compute and storage, provision of external hard-drives (upon request), and to build up a pot of money to replace, repair, expand hardware overtime.
 
*All internal NIHR SLAM BRC/U funded academic projects are fully subsidised by our BRC.

**Output VAT**  

King's doesn't charge Output VAT on its supply of research services to certain funders such as research councils, Government Departments / Agencies, the EU and UK Charities, although where King's supplies them with non-research services (such as consultancy) Output VAT is charged. King's does charge Output VAT on the majority of research funding received from industry, including CASE awards, and this has been the situation since 1994.

## Open Access
All researchers supported by BRC/U, and / or publishing work supported by BRC/U, should be aware of NIHR policy on open access. NIHR has also produced a guidance document to explain the implications of the above policy to the NIHR Infrastructure.
